# Jeeves
Automated Joke Generation using a rule-based approach


## Dependencies
On bash
```
pip3 install nltk
python3
>> import nltk
>> nltk.download('book') 
```

## Usage
1. Extract "reddit_jokes.json"
2. Run all commands on the notebook called "Cleaner" (which will generate a processed version of the jokes)
3. Run "Funny_Words"
4. Run both Semantic and Syntax Joke Gen
5. Run Jeeves.

The quality is going to be substandard, hopefully it will be improved more.
